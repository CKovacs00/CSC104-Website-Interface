Repository for CSC intro to website interface class

Experiment with the different properties that affect text display, and various text formats to create effective and interesting page design. You can use for reference the constitution.html and style.css posted, which is just a plain black and white text version using some very basic CSS.

Be creative and come up with the formatting (text, background, spacing) to make this jump out and catch a viewer's attention.

My code outputs a couple example sentences with their placements on the page such as 1st or second paragraph. With the main title being bigger as the header and in different styles, fonts, and shadow levels to create an interesting testing ground for css designs.
